 *  Phase low-drive     |<--120-->| 60 |<--
 *
 *  Each of 3 phases is driven according to the waveform shown above but offset
 *  from one another by 120 degrees.
 *  A PWM drive scheme is used to control the phase output in proportion to the
 *  speed reference signal (0:100 percent). The are a number of strategies
 *  involving combinations of driving PWM on either the low-side switch, the
 *  high-side switch, and combinations of both.The PWM rate must be high enough
 *  that the high-side is not driven for any time longer than the boost capacitor
 *  can hold up the gate voltage (i.e. the PWM period is not too long - in this
 *  project at least 8 Mhz will be used). A simple scheme is adopted here
 *  whereby PWM signal is applied to the gate of the high-side switch during the
 *  high-side drive sector of 120-degrees.
 *  During the sectors low-side sector (120 degrees) the phase output is at
 *  0 V DC.
 *  when the low-side switch is driven, the logic signal to the FET gate is 100%
 *  "On" across the entire 120-degrees, resulting in the phase of 0 V DC.

 *  RPM of 6 pole-pair motor would be the commutation rate divided by 6.

 *  Each switch can be in 1 of 2 states:   ON / OFF
 *  Each 1/2 bridge has 2 logic inputs:
 *    IN: logic input which is typically driven by PWM signal from the uC
 *    /SD: logic input which essential enables or disables the bridge
 *  Each 1/2 bridge has 2 outputs:
 *    OUT_H: output to gate of high-side switch (typically ~20v for 2S-3S voltage range)
 *    OUT_L: output to gate of low-side switch (close to battery voltage)
 *
 *  The high-side and low-side switch of the half-bridge must never switch on \
 *  simultaneously which would practically result in a dead short Vbat->GND. The
 *  half-bridge drives the high and low outputs in a complementary fashion and by
 *  design provides a minimum specified dead-time between switching the output
 *  states. The signal to the HB from the micro discrete outputs is represented by
 *  the following truth table where each motor phase output may be in 1 of 3
 *  possible states:
 *    IN   /SD   |  OUT_H   OUT_L    PHASE OUTPUT  |  NOTE
 *     0     1   |    OFF      ON    OFF           |  DC 0 V (HB is enabled, low-side driven off/0v)
 *     1     1   |     ON     OFF    ON            |  PWM on High Side switch
 *     x     0   |     ON     OFF    FLOAT         |  phase output floats (negative-going or positive-going)
 *
 *  A simple PWM drive scheme is used whereby PWM signal is applied to the gate
 *  of the high-side switch during its 120-degrees of "On" time. During the sectors
 *  when the low-side switch is driven, the logic signal to the FET gate is 100%
 *  "On" across the entire 120-degrees, resulting in the phase of 0 V DC.
 *
 * Ideally, when a phase is at 60 degrees (half of its pwm-on sector) there should
 * be no change/disruption to its PWM signal. The timer capture/counter register
 * should not be reset or cleared - only the active timer/PWM channel is switched
 * between the 3 motor phases, so the overall PWM cycle should remain consistent.
 *
 * (1): turn off PWM of high-side phase (N-1) to start the "demagnization time" and
 * flyback-diode of the non-PWM switch conducts flyback current
 *
 * (2): assert /SD ==OFF  of (only!) the phase (N-1) PWM drive half-bridge - to ensure
 * that flyback diode action is complete (de-energizing the coil that is now being
 * transitioned to floating) - seems to be the only way to ensure the IR2104
 * asserts both switches non-conducting.
 *
 * Third: turn on low-side switch of phase (N+0) ^H^H^H^H - low-side phase (N+0) is
 * already active from the previous 60-degrees sector.
 *
 * Fourth: enable PWM on high-side switch phase (N+0).
